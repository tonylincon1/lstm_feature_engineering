# LSTM feature engineering to improve F1-score for classifying

Code used in "LSTM feature engineering to improve F1-score for classifying the level of earthquake damage to buildings", Applied Intelligence 2024.

## Abstract:
Earthquakes are natural disasters that cause great destruction. One of the consequences of earthquakes is damage to buildings. Given the complexity of damage assessments on building structures, early identification of structures with a critical level of damage may reduce risk and financial losses. This work aims to create a model to classify the level of damage in buildings. The method steps include data preparation, model training, hyperparameter optimization, use of feature engineering, and evaluation of the results. The model XGBoost trained with feature engineering obtained an F1-score of 0.7542, occupying the 4th position in the challenge and showing superior performance compared to other related works.
